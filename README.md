This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First download the zip file from GitHub and extract the files or clone the directory, Open the folder using VScode and open terminal. Make sure you have downloaded Nodejs and npm using 'node -v' and 'npm -v', if not install both node js and npm. After that, use 'npm install' in the terminal to install the dependencies and the packages and then run the server using 'npm run dev'.

You can use npm, yarn, pnpm or bun.

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
